# Reddit AMP Bot

This bot crawls some subs on reddit, and looks for posts which directly link to, or contain text with links to a Google AMP page.
It replies with a comment containing the url to the real original article.

Google AMP pages are [really evil](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/05/19/open_source_insider_google_amp_bad_bad_bad).
Google *claim* that it makes web pages faster, but it actually makes them [slower](https://unlikekinds.com/article/google-amp-page-speed).
It only benefits Google, helping them tighten their stranglehold on a free, open standardised web.

Publishers suffer through commoditisation of news.
Readers suffer because content is detatched from it's source, so articles from low quality or corrupt sources is presented just like legitimate content.

To avoid finding AMP links, you should switch from Google search to a pro-user alternative such as [Duck Duck Go](http://duckduckgo.com/).
Unlike Google, Duck Duck Go [do not track you](https://donttrack.us/), and their [search results are better](https://spreadprivacy.com/google-filter-bubble-study/).
Also, switch to a browser which is not Google Chrome, such as Mozilla Firefox.
