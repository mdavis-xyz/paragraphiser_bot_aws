Beep boop, I'm [a bot](https://github.com/mlda065/paragraphiser_bot_aws/tree/paragraphiser).

It seems you've posted a huge wall of text.
This is a bit daunting for users browsing reddit, so they're unlikely to read the whole thing.

It's ok to write a lot if you've got a lot to say. But perhaps you could insert some empty lines into your post, to break it into smaller, more palatable paragraphs? (Remember to press enter twice, not once)
