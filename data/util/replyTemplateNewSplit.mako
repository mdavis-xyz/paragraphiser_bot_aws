Beep boop, I'm [a bot](https://www.mdavis.xyz/paragraphiser/).

It seems you've posted a huge wall of text.
This is a bit daunting for users browsing reddit, so they're unlikely to read the whole thing.

It's ok to write a lot if you've got a lot to say.
It's great that you've already split the post into multiple paragraphs, however your largest paragraph is still ${max_length} words long.
Perhaps you could insert some more empty lines into your post, to break it into more palatable paragraphs?
