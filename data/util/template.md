Beep boop, I'm [a bot](https://github.com/mlda065/paragraphiser_bot_aws/tree/amp).

It looks like you've posted a [Google AMP link](https://www.socpub.com/articles/chris-graham-why-google-amp-threat-open-web-15847).

AMP is a proprietary walled garden which [only benefits Google](https://www.socpub.com/articles/chris-graham-why-google-amp-threat-open-web-15847) and hurts everyone else.
It is destroying the open web through anti-competitive violation of standards.
This is [bad for users](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/05/19/open_source_insider_google_amp_bad_bad_bad) because AMP pages [load slowly](https://unlikekinds.com/article/google-amp-page-speed) and allow Google to spy on you after you've left their search engine.
It is bad for publishers because it forces them to duplicate development effort, and prevents differentiation and customisation.

[Here is the normal link](${url}) to the article.
